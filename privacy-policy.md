## Overview

SmartForm ("we," "our," or "the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how our Chrome extension handles your information.

## Data Collection and Storage

### What Data We Collect
- **Form Field Data**: When you choose to save form values, we store:
  - Field types (text, email, select, radio, checkbox, etc.)
  - Field labels and names
  - Values you enter into forms
  - Website domain and path where forms are located

### What Data We DO NOT Collect

- ❌ Passwords or sensitive credentials
- ❌ Browsing history

- ❌ Analytics or tracking data

## Data Storage

### Local Storage Only
- **100% Local**: All data is stored locally on your device using Chrome's local storage API
- **No Cloud Sync**: We do not transmit any data to external servers
- **No Remote Access**: No one can access your saved form data except you

### Data Retention
- Data persists until you manually delete it
- Uninstalling the extension removes all stored data
- You can clear data anytime through the extension settings

## Data Usage

## Permissions Explanation

### Why We Need These Permissions

#### `<all_urls>` (Access to all websites)

- **Usage**: Stores data in Chrome's secure local storage

#### `activeTab`
- **Purpose**: To interact with the current tab when you use the extension
- **Usage**: Only accesses the tab when you click the extension icon

#### `scripting`
- **Purpose**: To inject scripts for form detection and filling

#### `tabs`
- **Purpose**: To manage form profiles per website
- **Usage**: To associate saved data with specific domains

#### `notifications`
- **Purpose**: To show success/error messages
- **Usage**: Optional user feedback (can be disabled)

## User Rights
